============================

##Finally, a boilerplate I'm going to use (In progress).

####My wishlist:
  + **_Separate app & vendor files_** 
    + app and vendor files need to be bundled separately for faster refreshes since vendor bundle don't change often
  + **_nodemon_** 
    + include nodemon so we can watch for changes in express and middleware
  + **_security_**
    + must include anthentication **_and_** authorization modules for angular
  + **_bootstrap_**
    + should look good out of the box
